### 📜 Last Words from the Original Developer  
""Well, this is it. Have fun with it.

The code is a bit rough on many parts,
but can't say those weren't rushed as well.
Should be easy to expand or well... skid.

If the scraper ever gets outdated, code your own one.
Consider it an exercise.

Thanks for all you guys have done for us.
